# Traffic_flow-Analysis
Traffic Flow Analysis project uses computer vision to detect, count, and track vehicles from video data. It analyzes parameters like speed, density, and wait times to identify congestion patterns. The insights help optimize signals, improve road safety, reduce delays, and support smart city traffic management solutions.
